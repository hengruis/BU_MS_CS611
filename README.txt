NOTES:
- Values in the original txt files are not changed and optimized, which might cause some problems, for example, it is
hard for a hero to defeat a monster.
- Please use positive integer as index of items in market or other scenario.
- Check for inputs is not implemented yet. Please type valid numbers or characters.
- Implemented text colors.
* Perhaps need to change the paths of the configuration files in LMaH.java, but the program runs well in the local machine.
